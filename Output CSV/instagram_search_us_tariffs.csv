its.catubela,"This is one of those parts of running a small business no one really prepares you for   We've been in a grace period with the US tariffs, and that's ending soon. And the truth is... I don't know what's going to happen next.  Most of our customers are in the US, so this change affects everything ⭐️ from our pricing to how we move forward as a brand. It's terrifying not knowing if something you've built with your whole heart might be impacted by a decision completely out of your hands.  Being a founder means carrying that uncertainty. The weight of every 'what if.'  But I'm sharing this not for sympathy  but because I want to be honest. Because maybe you're building something too, and you're feeling scared too. And I just want you to know: it's okay. It's part of the path.  We'll figure it out. One step at a time.   #smallbusiness #womanownedbusiness #navigatingyour20s #smallbuisnessowner #smallbiz #ustariffs #tariffs",9957,191,7,2.0,2025-07-23T14:05:02+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMc_Buvokou/

xxl.scrunchie,"UNPACKAGE AN ORDER WITH ME  Instead of posting my ""pack an order with me video""...⁠ Shedding light on how US tariffs are affecting small biz owners in Canada ⁠ ⁠ Since April, I've been dealing with unexpected US tariffs charged to customers-sometimes up to 125%. It's led to refunds, returned packages, upset customers, and honestly... a lot of lost time, money, and energy.⁠ ⁠ Q: What are US tariffs?⁠ A: Extra taxes charged by the US gov on certain imports. Now, US customers ordering from me, might be charged 30-125% of their order total.⁠ Right now, it seems to be ~30%-so a $20 order could come with a surprise $6 fee.⁠ Before this, US customers didn't pay anything-and with 47% of our orders going to the US, it's a huge hit.⁠ ⁠ Q: Why is this affecting your biz?⁠ A: Most of our products are made in Canada, but some-like hair claws-are imported. If one's in your order, and your from the U.S. the whole order would cause a tariff.⁠ ⁠ Q: Why not get a US distributor?⁠ A: Our inventory is handmade and changes constantly. A US warehouse couldn't keep up-especially with limited edition drops. I'm also still managing marketing, customer service, content, and more.⁠ ⁠ Q: Why not just sell to Canadians?⁠ A: I'd love to-but I do all the marketing and content myself, and narrowing reach isn't as simple as it sounds. I'm just grateful for any support.⁠ ⁠ Q: Why not charge more for US shipping?⁠ A: We charge $9-$12 even though it often costs more. UPS starts at $40-and most customers wouldn't pay that. I wouldn't either!⁠ ⁠ Q: What's going on with the returns?⁠ A: Some were hit with tariffs and I had them sent back to contact the customer first. Others just got caught in the mix and delayed-causing even more rework.⁠ ⁠ I've been spending so much time refunding, emailing, and repacking when I wish I could focus on growing this business-not just trying to keep it alive!⁠ ⁠  Thanks for being here.⁠ - Tina ✨⁠ ⁠ #smallbusinesscanada #smallbusinessowner #SmallBusinessLife #BehindTheScenes #tariffs #canadiansmallbusiness #ustariffs #transparency #realtalk #entrepreneur #supportsmallbusiness",65162,2088,79,3.46,2025-05-19T10:03:27+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ1L285pn2P/
praffulgarg,"Trump's tariff threat is real.  From August 1, countries without a deal will face 15-20% duty on exports to the US. India is negotiating smart - holding back agriculture, offering phased access, and promising select purchases. But the game isn't over yet.  Without a final deal, Indian exporters could be hit by 30%+ duties due to BRICS penalties and sectoral levies. This will hurt MSMEs in textiles, pharma, electronics - all while US buyers are already freezing orders.  We need sharper, quicker trade strategy. This is not just about diplomacy. It's about protecting our businesses.",2797164,132149,580,5.14,2025-07-30T17:42:09+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMvYX1_TcwN/
america_nri_la_frustration,"Businesses, NRIs, and global markets are watching closely. Chudali em avudho  What Happened A federal appeals court just ruled that most of Trump's global tariffs are illegal. The judges said he didn't actually have the authority under emergency powers to slap those tariffs on so many countries at once. In short: he overstepped.  But the court didn't immediately kill them off. They gave the administration until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court. Until then, the tariffs still stay in place.  ⸻  Why This Matters 	•	It's a major blow to Trump's trade agenda. He wanted to use tariffs as a big stick to pressure countries like China, Canada, and Mexico. 	•	The court basically said, ""You can't just use emergency powers to reshape trade policy on your own-that's Congress' job."" 	•	If the Supreme Court agrees, it will limit how much power future presidents have to unilaterally mess with trade.  ⸻  What's Next 	•	Appeal: The Trump team is almost certain to take this to the Supreme Court. 	•	October deadline: If the Supreme Court doesn't step in by then, those tariffs could collapse. 	•	Markets & trade: Businesses that rely on imports are watching closely-if tariffs go, it could lower costs.  #Trump #USTariffs #BreakingNews #NRI #USPolitics #TradeWar",414647,0,15,0.0,2025-08-30T00:15:18+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN9WnY7DBPN/
retailboss,"It's official: President Trump just signed an executive order ELIMINATING the famous ""de minimis"" exemption for all low-value imports.   That means EVERY package under $800 coming into the US, from anywhere in the world, now faces tariffs and extra customs. U.S. customers are already seeing orders stall and can expect prices spike and shipments stall now and through the Fall. Say goodbye to shopping internationally, you will not find duty-free online finds anymore!   Millions of e-commerce orders will be hit: 1. Flat $80-$200 fee per parcel or country-specific percentage tariffs 2. No more loophole for Shein, Temu, or ANY international brand 3.Small businesses & global shoppers brace for price hikes and shipping delays  What online retailers outside US should do: •Retailers should update website and checkout processes to transparently show new tariff and shipping costs for US customers. •Reconsider which products remain viable in the US market, factoring in duties ranging from 10% to 50% or flat-rate surcharges per package  •Setting up or partnering with US-based warehousing and fulfillment partners will help avoid repeated tariffs    Consumers: get ready for higher prices, fewer choices, and shipping delays.  What are your thoughts on the executive order, is it good or bad for U.S. economy?   #BreakingNews #Tariffs #shoppingonline #TrumpExecutiveOrder #shopifytips #RetailNews #USTariffs #Retailboss #smallbusinessowners #smallbusinesslove #fashionbrand #GlobalBusiness #boutiqueowner #canadianowned",14774,0,18,0.12,2025-09-01T14:33:10+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOECeRhkVrR/
