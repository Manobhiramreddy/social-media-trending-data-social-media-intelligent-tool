ggkenkai,"I just built this Instagram Agent that will help you go viral so much easier.  It finds all your competitors in your niche..  Analyses all their reels..  Then also repurposes their scripts, creates captions, ready for you to shoot the video..   In like.. 20 seconds?  These types of agents and automations just make life easier.  But not only that - they're faster at finding everything. All the stuff you miss.  This is all built within n8n. And I've also just finished the Tik Tok version, too!  #n8n #instagramautomation #aiautomation #aiagent #contentautomation #instagramtips",531,26,5,7.91,2025-02-25T17:20:45+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGgQI80yIUM/
ggkenkai,"This agent gets smarter every single day in any topic  Imagine having access to all the world has to offer.. everyday.. on autopilot?  Then being able to access that information in seconds.  Any part of it. Anything about it.  And use it to your own advantage.  This uses a vector store (I'll just call it its brain) which stores all the information from 20 blogs of your choice.  It triggers everyday, capturing all the newest articles published. Never missing anything.  Then we can access this AI Agent and ask it about any critical things we should know. Perhaps the latest strategies, the latest trends.  We never miss a thing.  #n8n #aiautomation #aiagents #vectorstore #ragagent",351,7,0,2.56,2025-02-21T08:15:31+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGU-nEvxR9L/
ggkenkai,"I built this YouTube Automation that gets the highest performing shorts (for any niche)  Crazy automation in the right hands..  Let's say you wanted to do a faceless YouTube channel..  Well you use this, search for outliers in a range of different niches..  Analyze why their videos are doing well.  Then repurpose them for your own channel.  Or you could do it in your own niche. Your competitors, competitors you don't even know about.  This finds them.  #n8n #aiautomation #youtubeautomation",259,9,2,5.02,2025-02-17T03:04:17+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGKHwA2vInp/
ggkenkai,"How to copy any blog or newsletter from anyone in the world using AI Automations  This one here was fun to make.  If you're unaware, newsletter generate roughly 6 times the revenue than social media.  So creating newsletters is absolutely no joke.  As for blogs, well this is a great way of gathering traffic (duh )  With an AI automation like this, you can go out and find any newsletter that's performing well, and make the same thing in different topics, same topics, well it's up to you!  And of course, can do the same for blogs and posts as well.  For quality, I've also added things for the AI agent to do, like make revisions, create scores (ensuring it hits a certain criteria, making the newsletter or blog highly engaging and share-worthy from readers.  Another agent makes all the revisions, then it's validated to make sure everything is perfect and ready to be sent to the world.  #n8n #aiautomation #aiagent #techtok #newsletter #blog",184,6,0,3.26,2025-02-13T16:04:31+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGBN2GZywPu/
ggkenkai,"Make.com vs. n8n, which platform should you choose to make AI automations in 2025?  So this is an easy answer.  If you're looking for the easiest and cheapest option (but not cheapest when you scale), which only makes automations - go with Make.com  But if you want a more expensive (but cheaper at scale), which makes AI automations and AI agents, but comes with a slightly steeper learning curve - go with n8n.  Having used both - my pick is n8n.  There's just too many features I couldn't live without.   #n8n #aiagent #aiautomations #make #techtok",300,12,1,5.33,2025-02-11T05:01:53+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF639F7Pj0z/
ggkenkai,"This might be the craziest AI Agent Personal Assitant ever.  This AI Agent has access to nearly everything.  And I'm still working on it. I'll be creating Facebook ad agents, blog agents, and more.  Whole AI personal assistant is made with n8n.  #n8n #aiautomation #aiagent #aipersonalassistant #techtok",179,5,0,2.79,2025-02-08T15:17:53+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DF0QbdXsmAQ/
ggkenkai,"This YouTube Automation finds the best videos in any niche using n8n.  I've seen a few others making things like this. But they're missing absolutely crucial nodes which make this extremely powerful.  Now you can find videos in any niche which are performing extremely well.  But why?  So you can repurpose them and create content that is proving to work.  So you aren't confused with ""what video should I make today?"".  Saves time.   #aiautomation #n8n #aiagents",187,6,1,3.74,2025-02-04T06:00:12+00:00,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFo9ftjM3Y5/
